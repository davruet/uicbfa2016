      <div id="statement"><div class="subtitle">Tall Child</div><p class="statement-text">Humor has always been a coping mechanism through times of stress, and a creative outlet for feelings I can&#8217t unravel. Thus, it seems fitting that my work should be humorous, but connected to deeper experience. By juxtaposing playful imagery and melancholic storytelling, I create two layers in my work. This method allows me to give form to stories that may be too uncomfortable or undeveloped to be presented in traditional narrative form.</p><br><p class="statement-text">Through an eclectic use of visual mediums, I make digital art with old-school techniques, including animation, moving image and collage. My style draws heavily from my studies in graphic design and internet/pop culture, especially in the choice of typography and color, which is usually assertive and charming. I believe that surface legibility is imperative to creating work that will connect to a broad audience. This philosophy sometimes leads to tension between my artistic ideals and design aesthetic, but the strain of working through these goals drives me to push my own ideas of genre and form. My latest work falls inbetween the realms of live performance, puppetry, animation and experimental video.</p><br><p class="statement-text">While anxiously awaiting Frank Ocean&#8217s second album, I will continue to develop my skills in animation and video editing. I will hopefully be employed and have great hair. ~A girl can dream~</p><br><p class="statement-text"><a href="mailto:annagaiello@gmail.com">annagaiello@gmail.com</a></p><br><p class="statement-text"><a href="http://www.annaaiello.com" target="_blank">annaaiello.com</a></p></div>

      <div id="statement"><p class="statement-text">I create photographs that are relatable and resonate with the viewer on a personal and general level. My photographs provoke longing of something that once was, and encourage viewers to go back to times they remember or times they want to forget. The mind is selective but why? I highlight the mystery of what is remembered and what is forgotten.</p><br><p class="statement-text">Life is always being documented through photographs. The photograph has a reputation of being a reminder of past times, events and life. We look at photographs and form memories to go along with them. I am preoccupied with the subjective function of memory and how my own experience and self-knowledge are constructed through this imperfect process.</p><br><p class="statement-text">I tend to work with the past because it provokes my fears. While confronting my anxiety about forgetting the important, I see that forgetting is unavoidable. I begin with what I strain to remember on a daily basis. I have discovered obsessions related to the inability to remember, and the selection of what to forget.</p><br><p class="statement-text">I found myself returning to photographs that preserve the physicalities of people I have lost, and the memories that are left. I grapple with the notion that human existence is proven through photographs. How has anyone existed without photographic documentation? I find reassurance when I capture the world around me in a documentary style, making sure to secure anything I may want to look back on. I want to be able to restore the absence of what once was, even if it is only temporary.</p><br><p class="statement-text">After UIC, I will be attending Illinois State University to receive a Masters in Art Education as well as certification to teach K&ndash;12 in the state of Illinois. I will work for ISU&#8217s advertising department. After graduate school, I plan to teach and expand my current photographic business: McKenzie Bigliazzi Photography.</p></div>

      <div id="statement"><div class="subtitle">Artist&nbsp;/ Art Historian&nbsp;/ Art Educator</div><p class="statement-text">I make art about my family and my cultural identity, using my personal experience to raise larger questions of language, gender, immigration and assimilation. Using photography, poetry, video, oral history and objects such as embroidery, heirlooms and other ephemera, I process how cultural systems work within my family and have affected subsequent generations. Growing up in a Mexican household, I was taught to have a specific set of values that I now try to question and challenge as an adult. I want to know why my short hair and queerness is deviant, why the men in my family never smile and how my grandmother&#8217s only daughter was almost not allowed to go to college. But I&#8217m also curious about how societal norms are changing and what it means for Latin@s like myself who have to confront their identity as Latino/Chicano, and how we assimilate into American culture.</p><br><p class="statement-text">My work as a community engagement intern at Gallery 400, as well as my love for art history and museums, has inspired me to work with the public to connect people to art. In addition to my own artistic practice, I hope to have a role as a programmer, educator and curator.</p><br><p class="statement-text"><a href="mailto:amanda.cervantes94@gmail.com">amanda.cervantes94@gmail.com</a></p><br><p class="statement-text"><a href="https://vimeo.com/user16852832">Vimeo</a></p></div>

      <div id="statement"><div class="subtitle">Phenomenological Alchemist</div><p class="statement-text">In observing natural systems one becomes part of them. Their illusionary magic, sublime nature and optical illusions reflect the ineffable and transitory nature of existence. My work engages natural phenomena through an exploration and manipulation of images and material that allows for the malleability and liquefaction of both. By using an alchemic approach, emulating/replicating processes of metamorphosis, I point to the unknown forces and invisible presences that exist in our minds&mdash;surrounding all objects, experiences, and memories&mdash;producing ethereal and psychological effects. My aesthetic synthesizes the organic and the machine tautologically.</p><br><p class="statement-text">I have assembled a series of works that use prisms, interference agents, microreflectors and light to recreate natural phenomena, illusions and the visible spectrum. I am drawn to phenomena that are scientifically explainable, yet leave us without a framework for interpreting of our direct sensory experience, challenging our view of a single, wholly determinable reality with a fluid picture of the senses as participatory organisms that reciprocally interact with their surroundings.</p><br><p class="statement-text">Images of clouds, which are imperceivable to touch, and contain with an ever-changing molecular physicality to them, hold a sense of mysticism to me. I rephrase this by creating scanograms, which topologically transform the landscape, then finally translating these into paintings. They imitate rarely occurring atmospheric mirages, replicating ephemeral moments in the digital realm.</p><br><p class="statement-text">It is unnerving to watch reality bend before one&#8217s eyes, morphed and perplexed by illusion. Something is happening on the horizon. Icebergs, mountains, clouds twist and change shape, move, disappear, elongate. The earth and the sky warp. The bending of light and image reconciles itself in systems of belief.</p><br><p class="statement-text"><a href="mailto:adamcipcic@gmail.com">adamcipcic@gmail.com</a></p></div>

      <div id="statement"><div class="subtitle">New Media Artist&nbsp;/ Illustrator&nbsp;/ Photographer</div><p class="statement-text">I find beauty in overlooked spaces such as peeling walls and cracks on concrete, which both have lines I connect to drawings and to my own mark-making. As a child I would often get in trouble for drawing on walls.</p><br><p class="statement-text">This interest has fueled my recent work, such as <i>Remnants</i>, in which I photograph run-down architectural features and ink on top of the printed images. Most of my subjects have been heavily influenced by my childhood, fairytales, pop culture and gender politics.</p><br><p class="statement-text">I&#8217ve always been drawn to fantasy stories and to the creatures described in them. The mermaid has captured my attention as a figure that is not fully human but an in-between and has become a central figure in my recent work. Mermaids are often depicted as erotic female creatures, yet without the human female reproductive organs. I find the mermaid beautiful and alluring through its form, movement and transcendence. Through my animated piece <i>Mermaid</i>, I explore the figure of the mermaid in an attempt to fragment and decipher the attraction to the form.</p><br><p class="statement-text">A related interest is character design. I make character designs for my own animations, stories, games, and sculptures. I&#8217m constantly thinking up mythologies and stories and developing the characters that inhabit them. They are the driving force, the central figures of stories, and have both a figurative and material presence. Through character design, I can incorporate everything from fashion to materials to environment.</p><br><p class="statement-text">The art I create always goes back to the vast imagination that was encouraged and cultivated since childhood. I try to keep that sense of possibility and liminality open in the art I create.</p></div>

      <div id="statement"><div class="subtitle">Video Artist&nbsp;/ Experimental Animator</div><p class="statement-text"><i>One word to describe me is serendipity. I&#8217ve had so many happy accidents with my work it&#8217s downright fraudulent.</i><br>&mdash;Andrew Grant</p><br><p class="statement-text">My work provides whimsical interpretations of familiar experiences, focusing on the meaning and consequences of everyday unconscious actions. The ordinary world is defamiliarized into a surreal space for observing the emotions that influence impulsive actions, such as angst, fear, paranoia, anxiety, anger, greed and depression. My intention is for the audience to experience my films the way they would daydreams.</p><br><p class="statement-text">Negative emotions are usually a starting point for my practice, especially how people experience and cope with them. I study the pressures of societal standards and how they impact our distinctive behavior. I use animation to depict characters in bizarre situations, many of which are from my own experiences living in a society that pushes gender roles, promotes consumerism and racially profiles. My films do not tell a complete story with beginning, middle and end. Rather, they are more like events with a lesson to be learned. They create metaphors for my critical stance against these norms, and how I feel weighed down by them. But the drama is undercut with hijinks, and exaggeration and a sense of the ridiculous.</p><br><p class="statement-text">In their own way, my films attempt to answer the question, &#8220;What would happen if we let our impulses take over our judgment?&#8221; This idea is reflected in both the content and the process of creation. Part of my work is done rapidly, through instinct, propelled by a series of unconscious decisions, imitating the subject I am depicting. I start with a central premise, but while planning, I improvise until I get there. Animation requires a long series of choices, and I embrace all of the opportunities that each accidental and hapless moment provides; it&#8217s a way of making art that helps me conceptualize life. </p><br><p class="statement-text"><a href="https://vimeo.com/user50835912/videos" target="_blank">Vimeo</a></p></div>

As it became increasingly necessary to begin questioning the world around me, this sort of wit faded to the background.</p><br><p class="statement-text">I went through a phase that almost everyone around me was enduring&mdash;one of exhaustion.

I had to consider if the cop car following me home on my skateboard had the same instincts.</p><br><p class="statement-text">I questioned why the value of a person was consistently measured by how much they contributed to the capitalistic structure. I wondered why my tuition debt was crippling me.</p><br><p class="statement-text">I began to research and uncover a system in America that ensured a bottom class through factors that made it difficult to think beyond the current day, things like busyness, malnutrition, racism and materialism.

Eventually, toil for the sake of toil became inherently virtuous, regardless of productivity.</p><br><p class="statement-text">My current art practice questions the forces that have shaped us to think this way and calls for the restoration of the original American dream&mdash;free time to achieve progress beyond the material.</p></div>

With my work I reveal the overlooked, take pride in the abnormal and celebrate what most people, consciously or unconsciously, try not to see. With dark and humorous subject matter, I utilize drawing, painting and sculpture to boldly give form to subjects that are quietly strange. Sometimes I use irony and satire to connect to my audience, and other times I make art based on what most disgusts me, both viscerally and intellectually. I believe if you can find a way to laugh at or claim the unspeakably horrible, you rob it of its power. By focusing on weird, dark aspects of humanity, I conquer my fear.</p></div>

      <div id="statement"><div class="subtitle">Artist</div><p class="statement-text">My work demonstrates and complicates the politics of displacement through my experience as a first generation Hmong-American. As an ethnic minority from Southeast Asia with no homeland, I have a desire to be heard and to be valued. I fear cultural extinction, so I create work that reveals the diaspora of the Hmong, questioning the roles of site and place, and instead looking in-between. I emphasize ephemerality as part of identity. This work is part of the larger question of what it means to belong, and how I join the conversation about the history of political refugeeism in America.</p><br><p class="statement-text">My work engages political and cultural space through installation, site specificity and social practice. With a background in painting, I use color as a dialogue&mdash;a tool for bringing attention to space, claiming space and recognizing how spaces are claimed. Hmong textile is vital in my work. It presents a call to the body, and serves as a surrogate for the Hmong body. I interpret the question of ownership, whether land or body, through the use of material placement and color mixtures. Art is a form that allows me to position my body and other bodies in relation to the Hmong diaspora, and to investigate the nuanced spaces between visibility and invisibility.</p><br><p class="statement-text"><a href="http://www.tshabher.com" target="_blank">www.tshabher.com</a></p></div>

I choose to work in depth with different technologies because if I can make my audience feel what I feel when I&#8217;m making my work, then maybe there&#8217;s a way to translate that back into the technologies we use everyday. I don&#8217;t reject technology; I reject our blind acceptance of the way we use it to communicate.</p><br><p class="statement-text">For the future, I&#8217;m not entirely sure where life will take me, but I feel like that&#8217;s half the fun. I do plan to stay local to Chicago for the immediate future, and continue to make work. Hopefully I&#8217;ll make it into a few shows, but nothing&#8217;s for certain! I just want to bask in the freedom of being an artist loose in Chicago.</p></div>

      <div id="statement"><p class="statement-text">Vulnerability Within the Home</p><br><p class="statement-text">The body is self-aware, pulsing matter. Through the lenses of darkness, vulnerability and surveillance, my work is a self-searching process that pans across the dynamics of my family. Whether these attributes result in specific memories, daily rituals or valuable belongings, each aspect of my artwork reflects on the relationship I have to both my self and my family. I am interested in the moment trust becomes threatening, and the consequences of giving public form to private actions. Seeing the home as a sanctuary for the deepest forms of intimacy, my work traces the ethical line between bodies in domestic spaces. I work without consent and make a spectacle of the unconscious body while exploiting vulnerability in the familial home.</p><br><p class="statement-text">Influenced by abstraction, conceptual art and performance, I am deliberate in the modes and conditions of creation for each piece, whether painting in durations of darkness, photographing myself for public display or presenting found objects. Through this growing collection of material, I construct and betray my identity through my family and by the manifested conditions in which I portray us. As I claim myself through these interactions and interventions, my portfolio illustrates our susceptibility in domestic spaces and destabilizes the trust we place in our families as their impact shapes what we become.</p></div>

      <div id="statement"><p class="statement-text">My art focuses on the intersections within social movements, showcasing their never-ending progression. I have worked to document the hip-hop movement that provided me and many young and old people of color a global political platform to represent and express our culture, politics and ideas. Because hip-hip is often criticized for violence that stems from systemic inequality, it was important for me to document how hip-hop is used to fight systemic oppression, and to archive the depth and complexity of music that falls under this label. My web series <i>CHICAGO UNPLUGGED</i> gives the audience a glimpse of how this music serves the fight for freedom. Representation matters; it is important to denounce Eurocentric and misogynistic narratives and create art that represents people in all communities. In documenting my journey of meeting amazing people throughout the city of Chicago, I hope to create art that shows how unity can co-exist within diversity.</p></div>

      <div id="statement"><div class="subtitle">Artist&nbsp;/ Photographer</div><p class="statement-text">With a photographic perspective, I study the way a body inhabits space and experiences the world. I draw upon my own physicality and philosophical interests, like phenomenology, to address the limits of representing those experiences. The camera is a tool that allows me to give form to abstract ideas, such as our physical senses, and interpret my subjectivity.</p><br><p class="statement-text">We live in an increasingly visual and technological world. More people have direct access to cameras therefore shifting the cultural landscape. How does a photographer react to these conditions? How can images function in the culture? In this environment, how can images change perception? Do images hold value individually or in relation to other images? I question what it means to be a photographer. I subvert received ideas about the photograph, such as the idea of the photograph as truth, or even the convention of using a camera. I invite the viewer to think about their body in relation to the photographic image. I use direct and indirect photographic processes, like the scanner and photocopier, to play with ideas of the production, definition, and representation of the photographic image. By bridging ideas about image culture and corporality, I push the limits of the photograph to take the viewer on a visceral journey.</p><br><p class="statement-text"><a href="mailto:diegopadilla280@gmail.com">diegopadilla280@gmail.com</a></p></div>

      <div id="statement"><div class="subtitle">Artist&nbsp;/ Craftsman&nbsp;/ Innovator&nbsp;/ Adventurer&nbsp;/ Mad Scientist&nbsp;/ Good Guy</div><p class="statement-text">Consumerism has produced a decline in spiritualism. Reality and nature are now secondary to media. Americans are glued to their phones, locked to their couches and lost in the Internet. Our television programming is exactly that, programming: how to dress, where to eat and how to interact. Corporate ubiquity is draining any historical specificity out of our culture; it is becoming the responsibility of the individual to be an individual. I am taking this opportunity&mdash;art&mdash;to exploit this conformity, state my individuality and establish a material cultural bank. TV, radio, print media and the Internet all provide inspiration for this ongoing project.</p><br><p class="statement-text">In <i>Life Cycles</i>, the plaster television immortalizes the already outdated tube TV. Projected on the plaster is video of myself in a green-screen-suit. I spin in circles until I can&#8217;t stand; my movement reveals a video of water circling a river, and a video of my commute from home to school is layered behind my body. It&#8217;s a composite of life cycles, organic and made-man, liberating and trapping.</p><br><p class="statement-text">Being outdoors, away from immediate societal pressures, is where I go to experience a un-advertised-to life, and establish cycles and routines that come from my own needs and interests. In the woods, the spinning stops.</p><br><p class="statement-text">My art practice serves the same function. Balanced chaos and planned intuition allow for an analysis and reformation of the set structures and cycles coiling around us.</p></div>

        <div id="statement"><p class="statement-text"><i>No matter where you go, there you are.</i></p><br><p class="statement-text">Humans live in a linear world. Photographs create a world of magic in which everything is repeated. They are significant surfaces. Philosopher Vilém Flusser attributes photographs to reductions of the four dimensions of the spacetime continuum&mdash;a way to freeze any moment. Photography can take on multiple roles, i.e record history, provide humor to text, bring to life an abstract notion, etc. As I am finishing up my Bachelors of Fine Arts in Photography, there are a few changes I have noticed within myself. Through the organization and process of image making, I have developed a heightened sense of awareness and attention to detail. This allows me to better maneuver my way around a conversation by use of deliberate actions. By the act of understanding the details that are present through frontal body language (in conjunction with speech)&mdash;micro gestures in the face, hands, body, and feet&mdash;and then learning, by way of trial and error, the most situationally appropriate way to react, I can indicate some truth in these gestures. Others may simply call it people watching. To recall the process of image making, I take affect from these examples of careful observation.</p><br><p class="statement-text">Photographs can tell a story, both in terms of showing us truth, and for entertainment purposes. My photographs invade personal spaces and concerns itself with the aesthetics of human form. I am motivated by my interest in nonverbal storytelling and draw inspiration from Cindy Sherman’s series Untitled because of its staged portraitures, and Jeff Wall’s work including <i>Mimic</i>, <i>Milk</i> and <i>The Storyteller</i> because of the title choice in relationship to the subject of the photograph. I also take from Leonardo Da Vinci’s work <i>The Vitruvian Man</i>.</p></div>

      <div id="statement"><p class="statement-text">As a black woman, I experience the marginalization of both my gender and race, the two spaces for existence into which I was born. I am in a constant battle between pursuing my interests and falling into positions that were predetermined for me. The idea of the double-consciousness is forever present in my world.</p><br><p class="statement-text">I form questions about the positions given to marginalized bodies in a racist and patriarchal society and the importance of this relationship in identity formation. I examine the roles in which people of color and women are allowed recognition in society and use visual language to inquire into the limits of this reality, both publicly and privately. Through art, I provide the possibility that bodies can gain autonomy and reside in a scope outside of cultural expectations.</p><br><p class="statement-text">My visual works analyze societal structures and the restrictions of gender and color. I seize the language of pop lyrics to undermine common cultural symbols and assert a new identity. I use pornographic images as source material, and through repetition, transform them into works that invite the viewer to reinterpret them, questioning their own assumptions. My goal is to appropriate images that contain Western cultural symbolism and juxtapose them with a myriad of media influences in order to challenge what is known about our sign systems. I seek a new vocabulary separate from that of hegemonic society.</p><br><p class="statement-text"><a href="mailto:sydneylshavers@gmail.com">sydneylshavers@gmail.com</a></p></div>

The pupil is both a hole and a dot of virtual ink, the iris both an evolutionary mandala and an ordinary muscle. Similarly, GIF art inhabits a space between video and still image. While GIFs are durational like videos, they are used online in similar contexts as images, and the file extension is technically an image format. In displaying GIFs, I choose to treat them as discrete images, rather than videos that would loop for a certain length of time and be programmed in a certain order. While each animated sequence has a beginning and end, the incessant repetition is something I don&#8217t want to interrupt. It is inherent to the format, and a uniquely mesmerizing aspect of GIFs.</p><br><p class="statement-text">My main goal this year has been to teach myself animation techniques, which is something I plan to continue. I want to embrace the internet as a location and distribution tool for my animation and illustration work, and finally become &#8220;famous&#8221; on Tumblr, Instagram, or whatever new social media platform is about to break out. I also want to open a couple of Etsy shops, one for laser cut acrylic jewelry and one for custom watercolor paintings of people&#8217;s dogs. My long-term goals are to bowl over 200 and remember to wear sunscreen every day.</p><br><p class="statement-text"><a href="mailto:meghan.treptow@gmail.com">meghan.treptow@gmail.com</a></p><br><p class="statement-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/romptart/">Instagram</a></p></div>

      <div id="statement"><div class="subtitle">Photographer&nbsp;/ Curator&nbsp;/ Organizer&nbsp;/ Activist&nbsp;/ New Media Artist&nbsp;/ Aspiring Filmmaker</div><p class="statement-text">From my love of film to social activism, I have always felt the urge to participate and create through drawing, photography or moving image. As a film buff, I was eager to use photography to address formal concerns like framing and composition, and I took portraits of my family and neighborhood. I then started using photography in conjunction with social movements. I joined the group La Voz de los de Abajo and VillArte and used the arts to advance our activism, document our work and publicize events. La Voz works in solidarity with the Campesino movement in Honduras and VillArte promoting the Arts in the Little Village neighborhood.</p><br><p class="statement-text">I enrolled in UIC to expand my experience with different media, develop my own artistic language and make connections with other artists. Although my art was independent from my social activism, it was always related. My work brings into question my habits and my perceived norms of society in an attempt to find the connections between us all. I take a social and philosophical approach to our consumer culture by presenting it recognizably, and then twisting it into a place of contemplation. I invite questions about our interaction with technology, the media we consume and that which we choose to engage with or ignore. My materials are everyday objects such as computers, magazines, photographs and other household items.</p></div>

      <div id="statement"><div class="subtitle">Photographer&nbsp&#43; Filmmaker</div><p class="statement-text">I explore the stories unfolding in my life. Through film, photographs, audio recording and writing, I use the documentary form to create work that is thematically and emotionally resonant with my current experiences. My project, <i>HOME</i>, documents my parents, who are divorced but still living at home together, in their most natural and comfortable of environments: our house. I investigate how they define and experience home, and what they have sacrificed to make a home for me. As an only child, our family structure creates a triangle, which makes us more dependent on each other. My process for gathering material is slow and intuitive: I simply observe, in the most patient of ways, until I gain a sense of what makes my subject unique and worth remembering. As soon as the feeling is present I hit record.</p><br><p class="statement-text">After graduation, I hope to continue working at the video department at UIC, and will sustain my documentary practice. I also am going to start volunteering at the UIC Hospital as a UI Care liaison for the first 100 hours, and then go into specialty units such as obstetrics and the baby cuddling/neonatal intensive care unit. And I plan to volunteer at PAWS Chicago or The Anti-Cruelty society to work with dogs. Also, I hope to travel outside of the US, maybe backpacking through Europe, South Africa or South America.</p><br><p class="statement-text"><a href="mailto:Paigeashley469@gmail.com">Paigeashley469@gmail.com</a></p></div>
